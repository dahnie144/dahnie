## Who am I really?

I am a student at Hochschule Niederrhein, MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany. I am       pursuing a bachelors degree in Wirtschaftsinformatik (Business Informatics). 

At the same time, I am working as a trainee at GEFA Bank GmbH, employed in Software Engineering. Here I have learned the following skills since employment in September 2023:

- Basics of Java Springboot and its hexagonal architecture
- Webdevelopment using JS, HTML and SCSS + Bootstrap
- Infrastructure, especially Microsoft Azure and APIs

At the moment, I am getting mentored on how to code with Angular 17.

In the future I also wanna learn React.js and TailwindCSS to be more flexible when it comes down to developing a web-based application
